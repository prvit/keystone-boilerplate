# KeystoneJS Blank Starter Template

You've created a KeystoneJS project! This project contains an AdminUI and GraphQL App.

You probably want to add Lists, Authentication, Access control and a front-end application.

## Running the Project.

Clone this repo using ```git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/prvit/keystone-boilerplate.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>```
To run this project first run `yarn install` then `yarn dev`.
Once running the Keystone Admin UI is reachable via: `localhost:3000/admin`.

## Next steps

This example has no front-end application but you can build your own using the GraphQL API (`http://localhost:3000/admin/graphiql`).
